# Movehome_db
This refers to the scenario of MOVEHOME, a fictional real estate group consisting of estate agents. The group is interested in creating a database or information system to aid its operations.

##Scenario

MOVEHOME is a network of independent estate agents in the UK that serves as a single online platform for advertising and marketing properties for sale or rent. The primary goal of MOVEHOME is to connect property owners/landlords with potential buyers or tenants. The platform's clients include landlords, prospective buyers, and tenants. Landlords register their properties for sale or rent at individual estate agents. When a customer expresses interest in a property, the estate agent responsible for that property arranges a viewing with the landlord. The local branch of the estate agent communicates with the landlord and potential buyers or tenants to confirm the viewing.

The system has information on each estate agent's branch offices, branch staff, and properties marketed by each estate agent/local branch. The system also keeps track of data related to properties sold or rented out. Details of an estate agent include their name, headquarters, registered address, website, and contact details. Staff information includes their ID, name, address, contact details, and personal information. Each branch is assigned a unique code, and the system records its address, contact details, and manager's name.

When a customer registers with MOVEHOME, they receive a unique code, and the system records their name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details. When a property is marketed, the system assigns a unique ID and records its address, location, description, accommodation details (room sizes and descriptions), rental demand or asking price, type, number of rooms, etc.

When a viewing is scheduled for a property, the system records information about the customer who will be viewing the property, the date and time of the viewing, and any comments the customer makes during or after the visit. For property sales, the system records information about the customer who purchased the property, the selling price, stamp duty, and commission paid. For property rentals, the system records information about the rented property, the monthly rent, advance payment, commission, landlord and tenant information, date of tenancy commencement, and date of tenancy termination.
